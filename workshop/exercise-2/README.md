1. Create an array named `ranking`;
2. As soon as a frog reaches the end, push it into the array.
3. Once all of the frogs have finished, write a message to the console as well as the first, second and third place frogs (as applicable).

Hint: You will need to use setInterval... 

### Challenge 1

It would be great if we could pick frogs at random from the stable, instead of simply taking them in order. Go back to code you wrote for Exercise 2.2 and see what you can change to make this happen. You will most likely need to use a `while` loop instead of a `for` loop.

### Challenge 2

The race needs some sprucing up. Make the game a more presentable! Flex those CSS muscles.

This could also include 

- replace the beautiful circles with actual frog images.
- announcing the winner in the page.
- printing each frog's progress.
- a podium for the winners.
- etc.
